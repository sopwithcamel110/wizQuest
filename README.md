# wizQuest
gets the number of what quest you input for the Wizard101 MMO


Written in python 3.8.5

Uses the requests and bs4 modules(generic web scraping) to search through each world questline url for quest name. When found, code takes and return the number of the quest in the world's questline. All urls are of the FinalBastion wiki page, which has the most readable HTML I could find that also did questlines.
